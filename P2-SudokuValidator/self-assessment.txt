SPECIAL NOTE:
I ran the program with the following bash script:
rm -f sudoku
gcc -Wall -Wextra sudoku.c -o sudoku -pthread -lm
./sudoku puzzle9-valid.txt
./sudoku puzzle2-valid.txt
./sudoku puzzle2-invalid.txt
./sudoku puzzle2-fill-valid.txt
./sudoku puzzle9-solve.txt
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Can verify wether it was valid or not. 10/10
- The program is able to verify wether a n x n table is valid or not.
2. Starts/joins multiple threads to speedup operation. 5/5
- The program does start/join multiple threads in checkPuzzle().
3. For n x n complete puzzle, can verify wether it is valid or not. 5/5
- The program is able to verify if a complete puzzle is valid.
4. The number of threads is proportional to n. 5/5
- The number of threads is 3
5. BONUS: Can complete puzzles. 2/2
- Completed the non complete puzzle that is 4 x 4
6. BONUS Can complete difficult puzzles. 3/3
- Couldn't find puzzle-hard.txt but made a 9 x 9 puzzle and it could complete it.
TOTAL: I think the total is wrong because the normal total adds up to 25 and the 
bonus makes it 30 so 30/25.
