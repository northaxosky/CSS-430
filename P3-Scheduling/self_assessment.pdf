ATTENTION: Slight changes made to driver, scheduler and list were made to help solve
the bonus questions.
FCFS: 5/5
- The algorithmn does FCFS scheduling
SJF: 5/5
- The algorithm schedules by the shortest job
Priority: 5/5
- The algorithm schedules the tasks by priority and if there are multiple tasks with
the same priority it schedules them alphabetically
Round Robin: 5/5
- The algorithm does FCFS round robin with time quantum defined in CPU.h
Round Robin Priority: 5/5
- The algorithm does priority scheduling with round robbing using the time quantum
Bonus: 4/5 - 5/5
- Believe I got both the bonus right but am having some issues setting the last value 
for the last process both round robin algo(for example Respone time for T8). I looked around and it seemed
to be an issue with memory and unfortunately I couldn't figure it out in the time i had left.
- Other than that I believe the CPU utilization and the table displays the correct info.
